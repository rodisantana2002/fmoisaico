abstract = {Background: In 2004 the concept of evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) was introduced at the ICSE04 conference. Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. {textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{C_Nienaber_2005,
abstract = {Software technology and computing resources have evolved and developed considerably over the past years and may be considered as the backbone of many business ventures today. However, the software project management environment has also changed and is continuously evolving. Currently software projects are developed and deployed in distributed, pervasive and collaborative environments. This means that traditional software project management methods cannot, and do not, address the added complexities found in a pervasive, distributed global environment. Projects thus have a high rate of failure. More specifically, software projects often do not comply with the traditional standard measurements of success, namely time, cost and specifications. There is thus a need for new methods and measures to support software project management. In this paper, software agent technology is explored as a potential tool for enhancing software project management practices in general. We propose and discuss)},
